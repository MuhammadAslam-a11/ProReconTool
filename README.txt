What is ReconToolWPF?
-----------------------------------------
This tool performs automated passive and active reconnaissance on a target web application, including DNS checks, crawling for forms and parameters, basic vulnerability checks, and report generation.

-----------------------------------------
How To Install and Run
-----------------------------------------

1. Download the 'ReconToolWPF' folder containing the EXE and all files.
2. Make sure you are running on Windows 10/11 (64-bit recommended).

3. If you downloaded a ZIP file:
   - Right-click the ZIP → 'Extract All...'

4. Open the extracted folder. Double-click the file named:
   ReconToolWPF.exe

   (If you see a Windows Defender SmartScreen, click 'More info' → 'Run anyway'.)

5. The application does not require installation—just run the EXE!

-----------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
-----------------------------------------
- If the app does not start, ensure your system has [Microsoft .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) or later. The app should run without .NET if published as 'self-contained'.
- If any antivirus blocks the file, add it to the allowed list (the EXE is safe if obtained directly from the developer).
